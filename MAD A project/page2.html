		<h1>Why is photography necessary for cultural preservation?</h1>

		<h2>Task 1:Identifying your audience</h2>
        <li>Everyone with a phone can contribute to this preservation, therefore the audience spans across all ages. </li>
        <li> Could be a bit more talilored tothe younger generation, maybe content creators, micro influences? However, it would be a good thing to bring in all ages and make it more inclusive </li>
        <Li>There are smaller ways it is happening already with the BBC allowing users to send in their photos of things in Scotland that week, like sunsets, animals, more cultural photos. However there is no empahsise on its impact on the culture . </Li>
        <Li>This will most likely be a broad audience as so many people with a phone can and are already contributing. </Li>
        <Li>There are no pre-existing expectations, but I think it is good to note the importance of the individual. As today we have access to a lot of photos and images but in the smaller communities or people’s everyday life it is important to document things to preserve our own individual cultural heritage. Whether it be for our future families or contribute to a larger operation. </Li>
        <Li>Because of the age range the demographics can vary. </Li>

		<h2>Task 2: Building audiance personas</h2>

        <P>Age: 16-30</P>
        <p>Occupation: student/ young professionals</p>
        <p>Web habbits: Tiktok, intsagram, VSCO, X</p>
        <p>Knowledge of topic: Not much knowledge about cultural heritage preservation</p>
        <p>Skills: good online presence, photo and video skills</p>
        <p>How to get them interested: find incentives, maybe already doing it without knowing</p>

        <P>These types of people would maybe have a different motivation behind why they are taking their photos, but in the end the outcome is still the same. The website for them will be more about brining awareness to what they are already doing and its importance. By posting photos of cultural things and using the relevant hashtags or descriptions will already allow a lot of their culture and traditions to be preserved. 

            There may be a need for more awareness to submit photos into certain domains to allow them to be stored effectively, and so there could be some information regarding this. 
            </P>

         <P>Age: 30-50</P>
         <p>Occupation: working, parent, </p>
         <p>Web habbits: Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, X</p>
         <p>Knowledge of topic:  More knowledge about cultural heritage preservation, but maybe lack of time</p>
         <p>Skills: Good photos, videos, maybe going to more cultural places</p>
         <p>How to get them interested: More awareness that they are helping, competitions, BBC weekly updates, more targeted media</p>

            <p>This other large age category has been blanketly generalized. These people’s lives will be less self-centered and potentially more family orientated. This means maybe a lower contribution, however they could be visiting more culturally significant places as day trips with children etc, so taking a few photos is relevant to this cause. 

                With the encouragement of going to these places to document their individual perspective and experience it could provide useful. 
                </p>

         <P>Age: 60+ </P>
         <p>Occupation: retired, or thinking about it</p>
         <p>Web habbits: Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp</p>
         <p>Knowledge of topic:  More knowledge about cultural heritage preservation, time to go and see more</p>
         <p>Skills: Good photos, videos, maybe going to more cultural places</p>
         <p>How to get them interested: More awareness that they are helping, competitions, BBC weekly updates, </p>

         <p>This age group stereotypically has the interest and time for this. They could be igniting old passions, and by brining awareness to taking more photos in relation to cultural heritage might be a great point of interest.</p>

         <h2>Task 3: Audience needs in relation to design</h2>
                
        <Li>The best designs are one that are sleek and easy to navigate. I plan to make sure this is the case here, not overcomplicating the design and allowing for clear navigation. </Li>
        <Li>I plan to keep the webpage clean and concise, getting to the point when necessary. This is so i can make sure I dont confuse anyone and allow people to see the importance clearly. </Li>
        <Li>I still want a visually pleasing and stimulating design to attract and allow for good engagement. But I don’t want it to be cluttered and too colorful to distract from the purpose. I plan to achive this by using eyecatching photos, and interestig fonts that are still easy to digest.</Li>
        <Li> I also plan to show case study examples of recent cultural heritage sites being preserved through photographs. To further more highlight the importance </Li>

            <h2>Task 4: Design mood board</h2>
            <div class="image-container">

                <img src="images /webpagemoodboard.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" height="250"> 
                </div>

        <section id="task5">
            <h2>Task 5: Target audiance summary</h2>

<P>The target audiance for the cultural heritage preservation website comprimises individuals of varying ages and backgrounds, with a focus on the younger generation, middle aged adults, along with seniors. The rationale behind this choice is the widespread accesbility of smartphone photography. Younger individuals, especially contnet creators and micro-influencers, are alreadt engaging in cultural documentation through platfoorms like tiktok and instagram. The website aims to raise awareness among them about the importance of their contributions.
    
Building audience personas reveals distinct habits, motivations, and potential challenges. for the younger demographic, the site will emphasize the inherent cultural preservation in their current activities, while for the 30-50 age group, it will highlighy opportunities to contribute during family outings. The 60+ age group, sterotypically, having more time and interest, could be motivated by reigniting old passions. 

in terms of design, the website should be sleek, easy to navigate, and visually pleasing. It will showcase Scotland's cultural heritage through multiple photos, including user-contributed content. The design will maintain a balance between visual appeal and a clean, concise layout, ensureing the message of cultural preservation takes center stage. Additionally, the site will feature case studies to exemplify the impact of photographing cultural sites. As seen in the mood boards, the website will take inspiration from National geographic and patagonia, and use the photography for much of the design, while adopting simplistic writng and fonts, to allow for the message and photos to attract many. I hope this sympilict modern desing will not only be visually pleasing but allow for acsessiblity for all ages. Overall, the goal is to attract, engage and educate the audiance about the significane of preserving cultural heritage through photography.</P>
