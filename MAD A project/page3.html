		<h2>Task 2: Incorporating the narrative plan into your portfolio</h2>
        
        <li>The use of clicking onto photos to direct you to other webpages with more information (as seen in the example screenshots below). Looks good, is easy to follow so is accessible. It means no unecessary attention is lost on things it keeps things clear and to the point. Less is more and ends up looking better and more sleek. </li>
        <li>Using paragraphs to deliver information as well as bullet point to allow for quicker reading. Some people like the more in-depth reading but itâ€™s good to summaries so people can read quickly if they wish.</li>
        <li>Potential video presentation on how to better take photos, this allows for multiple options for people to work with.</li>
        <li> I think by keeping it just text and photos will allow for a more accsesbile website that people are likely to engage in.</li>
