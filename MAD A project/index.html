		<h1>Why is photography neccessary for cultural preservation?</h1>
		<h2>MAD(A) Project Homepage</h2>

		<p>Photography is an invaluable tool for preserving cultural heritage, capturing moments in time that might otherwise fade into obscurity. Through the lens of cameras, we can document our individual perspective of the world, ensuring that the stories, landmarks, and traditions of our past continue to resonate with future generations. From ancient ruins to indigenous ceremonies, photography has the power to bridge the gap between the past and the present, connecting us to our roots and fostering a deeper appreciation for the diverse cultures that make our world so beautiful. Through this website we shall explore the profound impact of photography in safeguarding our cultural legacies.  </p>

	<h3>Links to portfolio pages</h3>

	<div id="menu">
		<p>*Adapt this menu and update the links to each page that you create for your portfolio. This will act as a menu for your work. e.g.*</p>
		<a href="page1.html">Week 1 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="page2.html">Week 2 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="page3.html">Week 3 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="page4.html">Week 4 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="page5.html">Week 5 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="page6.html">Week 7 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="page7.html">Week 8 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="page8.html">Week 9 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="page9.html">Week 10 tasks</a>
<p>Note the use of an under construction page. This lets you set up the infrastructure of your website but without having links that do not work undermining your design!</p>
